# Using the chStone Benchmark Suite with Hardware Performance Counters and perf

The chStone Benchmark suite is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of embedded processors. It can be used in conjunction with hardware performance counters and the `perf` tool to measure and compare the performance of different systems.

## Hardware Performance Counters

Hardware performance counters are special registers in a processor that are used to count specific events, such as instructions executed, cache misses, or branch mispredictions. These counters can be accessed and used to measure the performance of a system in real-time.

## perf Tool

The `perf` tool is a Linux utility that can be used to collect and analyze data from hardware performance counters. It can be used to profile the performance of a system and identify areas for optimization.

## Steps

1. Install the chStone Benchmark suite on your system.
2. Install the `perf` tool.
3. Run the chStone Benchmark suite using the `perf` tool to collect data from hardware performance counters.
   - For example: ` `
4. Analyze the collected data to identify areas for optimization and compare the performance of different systems.

## Examples

- To measure the number of instructions executed by the chStone Benchmark suite: `perf stat -e instructions chstone-all`
- To measure the number of cache misses: `perf stat -e cache-misses chstone-all`
- To measure the number of branch mispredictions: `perf stat -e branch-mispredictions chstone-all`
